This website is a `try out project`. I will be adding more contents to it as time progresses. 

To know about my other interests, do checkout my (/al-folio/publications/). It you can't anything there, sorry for wasting your time.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
